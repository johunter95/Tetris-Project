# Tetris-Project
A project me and my friend made for my Grade 12 Computer Science Final

A tutorial from the Youtube channel freeCodeCamp.org named "Python and Pygame Tutorial - Build Tetris! Full GameDev Course" was followed
and used for the primary mechanics of the game. Go check it out at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfvxp7PgQ6c. However, all graphics and
the "fast fall" mechanics were created by me.
